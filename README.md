# Sentiment_Analysis_NLP

Welcome to the **Sentiment_Analysis_NLP** repository! This project focuses on sentiment analysis using the RoBERTa model from the Hugging Face's Transformers library. Our goal is to classify text data from social media into sentiment categories, enabling insights into public opinion and emotional trends.

## Project Overview

**Sentiment_Analysis_NLP** employs advanced NLP techniques and machine learning algorithms to perform sentiment analysis on Twitter data. Using TensorFlow and the RoBERTa transformer model, the project aims to accurately predict sentiment based on the content of tweets.

## Features

- **Roberta Transformer**: Leverages the pre-trained RoBERTa model for extracting text features that are crucial for sentiment analysis.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes comprehensive cleaning and preprocessing of text data to enhance model performance.
- **Sentiment Classification**: Classifies tweets into various sentiment categories, providing insights into the emotional tone of the text.
- **Model Evaluation**: Utilizes confusion matrices and classification reports to evaluate the performance and accuracy of the model.

## Data Processing

The dataset consists of tweets that have been preprocessed to remove noise such as emojis, URLs, mentions, and special characters. This preprocessing helps in focusing the model on meaningful text content. Tweets are tokenized and encoded using the RoBERTa tokenizer to convert them into a suitable format for the transformer model.

## Model Architecture

The model integrates RoBERTa with additional dense layers to output sentiment predictions. It's trained using categorical cross-entropy to handle multiple sentiment classes and optimized using Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 1e-5.

## Training and Evaluation

- **Training**: The model is trained on a balanced dataset to mitigate class imbalance, using techniques like oversampling.
- **Validation**: Uses a separate validation dataset to tune the hyperparameters and prevent overfitting.
- **Metrics**: Evaluates using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with detailed confusion matrix visualizations to assess performance across different sentiment classes.

## Visualization

Training progress and results are visualized using loss and accuracy plots for both training and validation phases, helping in monitoring the learning process and making necessary adjustments.

## Conclusion

**Sentiment_Analysis_NLP** demonstrates how advanced NLP techniques can be utilized to understand and analyze public sentiment from social media data effectively. The project showcases the application of transformers in real-world sentiment analysis tasks, providing a foundation for further research and development in this field.
